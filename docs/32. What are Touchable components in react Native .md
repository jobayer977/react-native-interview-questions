Touchable components are the most basic building blocks of React Native apps. They allow you to make views respond properly to touches. When you wrap a view with a Touchable component, you make it respond to touch events such as the press. Touchable components provide a simple interface for creating components that respond to user interactions.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from 'react-native'

const App = () => {
	return (
		<TouchableOpacity
			onPress={() => console.log('Pressed')}
			style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue' }}>
			<Text style={{ fontSize: 20, color: 'white' }}>Press Me</Text>
		</TouchableOpacity>
	)
}
```
