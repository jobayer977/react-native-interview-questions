In React-Native there are two ways to write platform-specific code:

- Using Platform module
- Using Platform-specific extensions

**Using Platform module**

For Android

```js
import { Platform } from 'react-native'

if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
	// do something
}
```

For iOS

```js
import { Platform } from 'react-native'

if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
	// do something
}
```

**Using Platform-specific extensions**

For Android

```js
button.android.js
button.ios.js
```

```js
import button from './button'
```
