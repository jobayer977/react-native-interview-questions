React Native is a great framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. However, it has some disadvantages too.

- React Native is not a native app. It is a hybrid app. It is a web app that is wrapped in a native app. So, it is not as fast as a native app.
- It takes more time to boot up than a native app.
- Security is a concern. React Native apps are not as secure as native apps. When we choose banking apps, Expert not choose React Native apps.
