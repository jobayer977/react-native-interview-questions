React navigation works a bit differently from the react web navigation. For Example, if we have 2 screens `ScreenA` and `ScreenB`. When we first navigate to `ScreenB` from `ScreenA` its `componentDidMount` is called and also `ScreenA` remains mounted. After we go back to `ScreenA` its `componentDidMount` will be not called.
