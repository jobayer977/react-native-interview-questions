React Navigation emits events to screen components that subscribe to them. We can listen to focus and blur events to know when a screen comes into focus or goes out of focus respectively.

## Focus Events

It's common to want to perform some action when a screen comes into focus. For example, you may want to fetch some data when a screen comes into focus. You can do this by subscribing to the focus event.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
	React.useEffect(() => {
		const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('focus', () => {
			// The screen is focused
			// Call any action
		})
		return unsubscribe
	}, [navigation])
}
```

## Blur Events

It's also common to want to perform some action when a screen goes out of focus. For example, you may want to save some data when a screen goes out of focus. You can do this by subscribing to the blur event.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
	React.useEffect(() => {
		const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('blur', () => {
			// The screen is unfocused
			// Call any action
		})
		return unsubscribe
	}, [navigation])
}
```

## beforeRemove Event

The `beforeRemove` event is emitted when the screen is about to be removed from the stack. This event is emitted when the screen is popped or replaced. You can use this event to prevent the screen from being removed from the stack.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
	React.useEffect(() => {
		const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('beforeRemove', (e) => {
			// Prevent default behavior of leaving the screen
			e.preventDefault()
			// Prompt the user before leaving the screen
			Alert.alert('Hold on!', 'Are you sure you want to leave?', [
				{ text: "Don't leave", style: 'cancel', onPress: () => {} },
				{
					text: 'Leave',
					style: 'destructive',
					// If the user confirmed, then we dispatch the action we blocked earlier
					// This will continue the action that had triggered the removal of the screen
					onPress: () => navigation.dispatch(e.data.action),
				},
			])
		})
		return unsubscribe
	}, [navigation])
}
```
