title: Does React Native use a WebView?

React Native uses a JavaScript runtime, but the UI is not HTML and it doesn't use a WebView. We use JSX and React Native-specific components to define the UI. It provides a native-level performance and looks and feels but some UI parts have to be configured separately for iOS and Android.
