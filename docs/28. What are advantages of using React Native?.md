- Large community: React Native has a large community of developers who are constantly working on improving the framework. This means that we can get help from the community if we run into any issues while developing our app.
- Reusable code: React Native allows us to reuse our code across different platforms. This means that we can write our code once and use it on both Android and iOS.
- Additional Third-Party Libraries: React Native has a large number of third-party libraries that we can use to add additional functionality to our app. This means that we don't have to write all the code from scratch.
