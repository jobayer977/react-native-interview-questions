TextInput is a core component of React Native that allows the user to enter text. It has an API that is very similar to that of the HTML input element, with support for auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and more.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

import { TextInput, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

const App = () => {
	const [value, onChangeText] = useState('Useless Placeholder')

	return (
		<View>
			<TextInput onChangeText={(text) => onChangeText(text)} value={value} />
		</View>
	)
}
```
