Fast Refresh is a new feature in React Native that allows us to get direct feedback for changes in our React components. It is enabled by default in the React Native CLI.

It works for example if we change the text in the App.js file from "Hello World" to "Hello World!". it will update this component without reloading the entire application. An alterant if we have a util file and we change the file those changes will be re-render in the other files that are using that util file.
