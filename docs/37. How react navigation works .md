React Native doesn't have a built-in idea of a global history stack as a web browser does. Instead, React-navigation's native stack navigator provides a way for the app to transition between screens and manage navigation history. If our app uses only one stack navigator then it is conceptually similar to how a web browser handles navigation state. the app pushes and pops items from the navigation stack as users interact with it, and this results in the user seeing different screens. A key difference between how this works in a web browser and React Navigation is that React Navigation's native stack navigator provides the gestures and animations that we would expect on Android and iOS when navigating between routes in the stack.
