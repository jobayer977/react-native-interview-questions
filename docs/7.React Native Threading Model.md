title: What is React Native Threading Model ?

There are 3 main threads in React Native:

1. Main thread
2. JS Thread
3. Native Modules Thread

**Main thread**
The Main thread listens to the UI events like 'press', 'touch', etc. These events are then passed to the JS thread via the RN Bridge. Once the Javascript loads, the JS thread sends the information on what needs to be rendered onto the screen.

**JS Thread**
The Javascript Queue is the thread queue where the main bundled JS thread runs. The JS thread runs all the business logic, i.e., the code we write in React Native.

**Native Modules Thread**
If an app needs access to platform API, this is where the magic happens.
