The bridge concept leverages the library and transfers the component’s hierarchy to the mobile devices view.\n\nFor instance, if the user presses a button, this case is translated into an event that JavaScript can handle. After that, by relaying messages between native platforms and JS code, the React Native bridges translates native events into something that React components can understand and work with.\n","section":"6.How react native works internally.md","source":"https://www.reactnative.guide/"}],"7.React Native Threading Model.md":[{"title":"What is React Native Threading Model ?","content":"\nThere are 3 main threads in React Native:\n\n1. Main thread\n2. JS Thread\n3. Native Modules Thread\n\n**Main thread**\nThe Main thread listens to the UI events like 'press', 'touch', etc. These events are then passed to the JS thread via the RN Bridge. Once the Javascript loads, the JS thread sends the information on what needs to be rendered onto the screen.\n\n**JS Thread**\nThe Javascript Queue is the thread queue where the main bundled JS thread runs. The JS thread runs all the business logic, i.e., the code we write in React Native.\n\n**Native Modules Thread**\nIf an app needs access to platform API, this is where the magic happens.\n","section":"7.React Native Threading Model.md","source":"https://digitalya.co/"}],"8.
